# Tech Stack
1. Used Ensemble Machine Classifying methods to classify the symptoms entered by the user. The accuracy achieved by the model is 98.2% using Random Forest classifier.
2. Used flask server for the model deployment on Heroku.
3. The frontend is made using bootstrap template.


# Future Scope
1. Would work on enabling NLP on the chatbot to make it interactive for the users.
